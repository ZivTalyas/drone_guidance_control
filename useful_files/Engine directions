Throttle Control:

Move up:
F_thrust > mg -> acceleration at Z axis
2 props at the X axis move clockwise
2 props at the Y axis move unclockwise

Move Down:
F_thrust < mg -> acceleration at Z axis
2 props at the X axis move clockwise
2 props at the Y axis move unclockwise

Roll control:

Roll right:
2 props at the left side move faster at the same speed (but opposite direction of rotation) and the other 2 props move slower at the same speed.

Roll left:
2 props at the right side move faster at the same speed (but opposite direction of rotation) and the other 2 props move slower at the same speed.

Pitch control:

Move forward:
2 engines at the back of the drone move faster (but opposite direction of rotation) than the forward engines.

Move back:
2 engines at the forward of the drone move faster (but opposite direction of rotation) than the back engines.

Yaw control:

Rotate left:
2 engines at Y axis rotating at same same direction and moving faster than the other 2 engines.

Rotate right:
2 engines at X axis rotating at same same direction and moving faster than the other 2 engines.
